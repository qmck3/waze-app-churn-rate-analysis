![alt text](https://github.com/qmck3/waze-app-churn-rate-analysis/blob/main/images/Dashboard.png)

## Summary of Insights
- Users who drive very long distances on their driving days are _more_ likely to churn
- Users who drive more days in that month are often _less_ likely to churn.
- The reason for this discrepancy is an opportunity for further investigation, and it would be something else to ask the Waze data team about.

### Questions and Recommendations
- Why so many users used the app so much in just the last month 
- Has the app been measuring the kilometer driven last month incorrectly since the velocity of every drivers are so fast.
- Why the maximum number of days between activity_days (31) and driving_days (30) are different
